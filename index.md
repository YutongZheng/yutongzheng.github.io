## About
"Before we judge, seek to understand."

I'm a senior Ph.D. student from the ECE department at Carnegie Mellon University (check out my [Resume](https://yutongzheng.github.io/pdf/Resume-2022.pdf)). My current interests lie broadly in the intersection of generative model, computer vision and disentangled representation learning. I worked with [Prof. Marios Savvides](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/savvides-marios.html) at the CyLab Biometrics Center. I also work closely with Oosto (formerly AnyVision), a visual AI company, taking charge of cooperative tasks under [Dr. Guosheng Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guosheng-hu-6801b333/?originalSubdomain=uk). Some of my previous works were put into application in Bossa Nova Robotics, Walmart and the government issued projects for criminal investigation. 

Much of my work is centered around the problem of semantic disentanglement and representation learning. Building semantically interpretable representations of data are of paramount importance. Ideally, a single good representation would be interpretable for a human that requires minimal supervision to obtain. Towards this goal, representations learned by modeling the natural processes are presumably more treasured. Some of my work has explored learning such representations by 1) loss function that normalizes the energy of neuron clusters, 2) a sparse constraint that captures local facial perturbations to mimic muscle distribution, and finally 3) inductive biases in generator architectures that explicitly promote pose variation and symmetry. Video and/or binocular dataset has also emerged as a promising direction that promotes rich representation learning through stereopsis while requiring minimum supervision. Some of my ongoing work aims to provide a better understanding of the phenomenon of stereopsis, paving the way for the development of more effective techniques.
